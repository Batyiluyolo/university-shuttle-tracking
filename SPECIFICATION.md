- Route optimization and scheduling
- Web-based interface for students and staff
- Administrator dashboard for managing shuttle operations

## 2. Functional Requirements
- Track shuttle locations in real time
- Display estimated arrival times
- Allow route and schedule updates
- Provide notifications for delays or changes

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- High availability and reliability
- Secure user authentication
- User-friendly interface

## 4. Technologies Used
This is a conceptual design; the following technologies could be used:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- GPS Tracking API: Google Maps API

## 5. Use Case Diagram
This use case diagram will illustrate interactions between students, drivers, and administrators in the system.
