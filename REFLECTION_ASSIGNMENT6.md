# Reflection: Agile Planning for the CPUT Shuttle Tracking Web App  

## **1. Introduction**  
In this assignment, I applied Agile planning to structure the development of the **CPUT Shuttle Tracking Web App**. This included creating **user stories, prioritizing a product backlog, planning a sprint, and defining tasks** for execution.  

The goal was to ensure the development process remained **flexible, user-focused, and iterative** while delivering the most critical system features first. While Agile planning provided many advantages, it also introduced several challenges that needed to be addressed.

## **2. Challenges Faced in Agile Planning**  

### **2.1 Defining Clear User Stories**  
One of the biggest challenges was writing **clear and concise user stories** that captured real system needs. Each user story had to:  
- Be **understandable by all stakeholders** (not just developers).  
- Follow the **As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit]** format.  
- Be small enough to be **developed in a single sprint** but still meaningful.  

For example, at first, I combined "Track Shuttle Location" and "View Shuttle Routes" into one large story, which made it **too broad**. Later, I separated them into **two independent stories**, making them easier to prioritize and develop.  

### **2.2 Prioritizing the Product Backlog**  
Another challenge was **deciding which features were most important**. Using the **MoSCoW method** (**Must Have, Should Have, Could Have**) helped:  
- **Students tracking shuttles (US1) and drivers updating locations (US3)** were **Must Have** features.  
- **Generating reports (US8) and receiving notifications (US11)** were **Could Have** features, meaning they could be developed in later sprints.  

At first, I considered implementing **more features in Sprint 1**, but after estimating **story points**, I realized that **42 story points** was the maximum feasible workload.  

### **2.3 Breaking Down User Stories into Tasks**  
Once I finalized the **sprint backlog**, I had to split each user story into **small, actionable tasks**. Some challenges included:  
- Ensuring each task was small enough for one developer to complete.  
- Maintaining **logical dependencies** (e.g., UI design before API integration).  
- Keeping the task descriptions **clear and specific**.  

For example, the **"Track Shuttle Location"** story was broken into:  
1️⃣ **Design the UI for real-time tracking**  
2️⃣ **Implement API call to fetch GPS location**  
3️⃣ **Display shuttle location on a map**  

This method ensured the **team could work in parallel** rather than waiting for one big feature to be finished.  

### **2.4 Managing Sprint Workflow Without Automation**  
Since the assignment focused on **documentation only**, I didn’t use GitHub Issues & Projects to manage the sprint. Instead, I had to **manually document the sprint workflow** in `SPRINT_PLAN.md`.  

This was challenging because:  
- Agile teams typically use **Kanban boards** to track progress (To Do → In Progress → Done).  
- Without a live task-tracking system, tracking sprint progress required careful **manual updates**.

## **3. Lessons Learned from Agile Planning**  

### **3.1 Agile Improves Flexibility and User Focus**  
One key lesson was that **Agile forces teams to focus on user needs**. By writing user stories, I had to **think from the perspective of students, drivers, and administrators** rather than just listing system features.  

For example, instead of saying **"The system must update GPS every 10 seconds,"** Agile requires:  
✅ **"As a student, I want to track my shuttle in real-time so that I don’t miss it."**  

This **user-focused approach** makes development **more meaningful and impactful**.  

### **3.2 Prioritization Prevents Overloading the Sprint**  
The **MoSCoW method** helped me realize that **not all features are equally important**. Initially, I planned to include **security features and notifications in Sprint 1**, but after estimating the workload, I realized that focusing on the **core tracking features first** was better.  

This prevented **developer overload** and ensured **Sprint 1 had a realistic workload**.  

### **3.3 Agile Encourages Continuous Improvement**  
Because Agile follows an **iterative cycle**, the **Sprint Retrospective** allows teams to **identify what went well and what can be improved** for the next sprint.  

For example, if a feature is delayed, the team can ask:  
- **Was the task too big?**  
- **Were dependencies not well planned?**  
- **Did we encounter unexpected technical issues?**  

This iterative mindset helps **teams become more efficient over time**.

## **4. How Agile Planning Helped Structure the Project**  
Applying Agile planning to this project helped in several ways:  
✔ It **ensured the most important features were developed first** (Sprint prioritization).  
✔ It **made the project more manageable** by breaking it into **small, clear tasks**.  
✔ It **helped balance development workload** to avoid sprint overload.  
✔ It **improved clarity for all stakeholders** (Students, Drivers, Admins, Security).  

Even though this assignment focused **only on documentation**, it simulated a **real-world Agile environment**, making it easier to transition into **actual Agile development**.

## **5. Conclusion**  
Agile planning provided a **structured approach** to software development. While there were **challenges** in defining user stories, prioritizing the backlog, and planning sprints, these challenges **helped clarify project requirements and improve task management**.  

The Agile process also emphasized **continuous improvement** and **flexibility**, ensuring that development remains **user-focused and iterative**.  

By applying Agile planning to the **CPUT Shuttle Tracking Web App**, I gained valuable experience in **structuring and executing software development efficiently**. This knowledge will be essential in future projects, whether working in teams or managing development independently.
