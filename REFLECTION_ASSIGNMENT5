# Reflection: Translating System Requirements into Use Cases and Test Cases  

## **1. Introduction**  
In this assignment, I translated stakeholder and system requirements into **use case diagrams, detailed use case specifications, and test cases** for the CPUT Shuttle Tracking Web App. This process involved **identifying key actors, defining system interactions, and ensuring that functional and non-functional requirements were testable**.  

The transition from high-level requirements (Assignment 4) to detailed use cases and test cases was both challenging and insightful.

## **2. Challenges Faced**  

### **2.1 Defining Clear Use Cases**  
One of the biggest challenges was **ensuring that each use case was clearly defined** with a well-structured **precondition, flow, and postcondition**. Some use cases, like **"Manage Shuttle Operations,"** involved multiple actors (administrators and service providers), which required careful handling of different scenarios.  

Additionally, ensuring **use cases did not overlap or duplicate functionality** required multiple iterations and reviews. In some cases, I had to refine the wording to ensure **clarity and consistency** across all use cases.  

### **2.2 Determining Actor Interactions**  
Understanding how different **actors interact with the system** was complex, particularly for roles like **campus security and IT support**. Unlike students or shuttle drivers, who have direct system interactions, these actors have **more indirect responsibilities**, such as **monitoring logs and handling system performance issues**. This made it challenging to define clear system boundaries for their use cases.  

Another complexity was ensuring that **all key actors had at least one interaction** with the system. Initially, I overlooked some interactions for **the Shuttle Service Provider**, which I later corrected.  

### **2.3 Writing Test Cases for Non-Functional Requirements**  
While writing functional test cases (e.g., tracking shuttle location, updating schedules) was straightforward, **testing non-functional aspects like performance and security was more difficult**.  

For example:  
- **Performance Testing:** Simulating 1000+ concurrent users to verify system responsiveness.  
- **Security Testing:** Ensuring **secure authentication** and **data encryption**.  

Since non-functional requirements do not always have step-by-step user interactions, their test cases had to focus on **system behavior under specific conditions** rather than verifying individual actions.

## **3. Lessons Learned**  

### **3.1 Importance of Use Case Diagrams**  
Creating a **Use Case Diagram** before defining use case specifications helped **visualize system interactions**. It ensured that every key function had a corresponding actor and that relationships between use cases (e.g., `<<include>>` and `<<extend>>`) were correctly structured.  

Without this step, it would have been harder to ensure that **all required system functionalities were properly documented**.  

### **3.2 Thinking Like a User**  
Writing use cases and test cases forced me to **think from the perspective of different stakeholders**. This approach ensured that system functionality was **realistic and aligned with user needs**.  

For example:  
- When defining **"Monitor Shuttle Logs,"** I considered how security personnel would access and use historical data.  
- For **IT Support**, I included a use case for **system diagnostics**, which I had initially overlooked.  

### **3.3 Test Cases Improve System Quality**  
By **writing test cases alongside use cases**, I realized how important **testing is in software development**. Without structured test cases, some **edge cases** (e.g., GPS failures, system downtime) might have been **overlooked** during implementation.  

Additionally, ensuring that test cases covered **both functional and non-functional requirements** helped make the system more reliable.

## **4. How This Helps in Real-World Development**  
This assignment provided a **real-world software engineering experience**. In industry, teams must:  
- Define **clear system interactions** before coding.  
- Write **test cases early** to ensure system reliability.  
- Balance **functional and non-functional requirements** while keeping **stakeholder concerns in mind**.  

Having well-structured **use cases and test cases** makes development **more efficient** and ensures the system meets user expectations.  

Additionally, structured test cases are critical for **quality assurance (QA) teams**. In professional software development, **automated testing** is often used to validate core functionalities, and this assignment helped me understand the importance of **clear and structured test cases** in achieving this goal.

## **5. Conclusion**  
Overall, this assignment reinforced the importance of **structured system design, user interaction modeling, and quality assurance through testing**. While defining use cases and test cases was challenging, it **helped bridge the gap between system requirements and actual system behavior**.  

These skills will be valuable in **software development, quality assurance, and system architecture** in the future. By going through this structured process, I gained a deeper understanding of **how system requirements evolve into functional components that can be implemented and tested effectively**.
