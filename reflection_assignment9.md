# Reflection – Assignment 9: Domain Model and Class Diagram

Designing the domain model and class diagram for the University Shuttle Tracking Web App gave me a deeper understanding of system architecture and object relationships. This task allowed me to identify core entities such as User, Driver, Student, Shuttle, Trip, Schedule, and Route, and consider how they interact to support real-time tracking and scheduling.

Creating the domain model helped me carefully define business logic. I had to decide which attributes were necessary for each entity and what operations (methods) each class needed to support user interaction and system functionality. This process made me more aware of how object-oriented design supports modularity and reuse in software systems.

The class diagram required me to visualize inheritance (e.g., Student and Driver inheriting from User) and associations like "a Shuttle has many Trips" or "a Trip follows a Route." Using Mermaid.js forced me to write clean, structured code that could render properly, and this helped reinforce my understanding of class syntax and diagramming best practices.

One challenge I faced was choosing the correct level of detail. I initially added too many attributes and methods, but I realized it was better to keep the model focused and aligned with the system’s core use cases. Another challenge was formatting the Mermaid syntax correctly—simple mistakes like placing brackets wrong or mixing up inheritance arrows caused errors in rendering.

If I were to improve anything, I would spend more time planning the model on paper or with a draft sketch before jumping into Mermaid syntax. This would make the implementation faster and more accurate.

Overall, Assignment 9 helped me bridge the gap between user requirements and object-oriented design. It made me appreciate how structured modeling can simplify both development and communication of system architecture.
