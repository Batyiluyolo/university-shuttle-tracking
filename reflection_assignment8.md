# ðŸªž Reflection â€“ Assignment 8: Modeling Shuttle Tracking System

Working on the state and activity diagrams significantly deepened my understanding of how the University Shuttle Tracking System operates. By breaking the system into distinct objects (like Shuttle, Trip, Driver, etc.), I was able to clearly define how each part transitions between different states and how users interact with them.

Through the activity diagrams, I visualized step-by-step user and admin workflows. It helped me identify hidden assumptions, like how signal loss impacts location tracking, and why validation is important when users update their accounts or routes.

One of the challenges I faced was getting the **Mermaid.js syntax** to render correctly on GitHub. I learned how sensitive it is to parentheses, labels, and indentation. But fixing those issues made me more comfortable writing clean diagram code in Markdown.

Another challenge was choosing the right number of diagrams and not repeating what I had already done in previous assignments. I had to carefully match each diagram to functional requirements and sprint tasks, which helped me stay aligned with what the system is meant to deliver.

If I were to do this again, I would start with a clear diagram plan upfront â€” listing out all 7 state and 8 activity diagrams early â€” to avoid duplication or confusion. Overall, this assignment helped me connect system behavior to visual models and better prepare for implementation.
