## **Reflection on Challenges Faced**

### **1. Balancing Stakeholder Needs**
- **Students need real-time tracking**, but **IT staff want to limit server load** → Solution: Optimize GPS update frequency.
- **Drivers need simple interfaces**, but **administrators want detailed logs** → Solution: Create role-based interfaces.

### **2. Managing Conflicting Requirements**
- **Security personnel require emergency tracking**, but **privacy policies limit constant tracking** → Solution: Allow opt-in tracking for emergencies.
- **Management wants cost efficiency**, but **high accuracy in GPS requires expensive cloud services** → Solution: Use hybrid cloud-local tracking.

### **3. Technical and Usability Trade-offs**
- **Deploying the system on both web & mobile increases complexity** → Solution: Use a responsive web design instead of separate apps.
- **Fast data updates may slow performance** → Solution: Cache static data and update only necessary elements.

### **Final Thoughts**
This project required careful balancing of user needs while ensuring feasibility. Agile updates will help refine the system based on real-world feedback.
