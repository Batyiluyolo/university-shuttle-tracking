# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

## **1. Key Challenges**
### **1.1 Conflicting Requirements**
- **Students** demand **real-time tracking**, but **IT support** is concerned about **high server load**.
- **Drivers** want an **easy interface** to update their location, but **admins** require **precise GPS accuracy**.

### **1.2 Technical Constraints**
- Implementing **low-latency tracking** requires a **high-performance backend**, which affects **budget**.
- Ensuring **scalability** for **1,000+ users** requires **cloud-based infrastructure**, increasing costs.

### **1.3 Security vs Usability**
- **Strict security (e.g., two-factor authentication)** could slow down **user logins**.
- **Balancing encryption** with **fast data retrieval** is crucial.

## **2. Lessons Learned**
- **Prioritization is Key** – Not all features can be implemented at once.
- **Trade-offs are Necessary** – A balance between usability, security, and performance must be found.
- **Stakeholder Communication** – Regular feedback helps align expectations.
