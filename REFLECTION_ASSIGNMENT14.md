# Reflection – Assignment 14

This reflection outlines my experience during the peer review and open source collaboration phase of the University Shuttle Tracking Web App.

---

## Feedback Received

During this assignment, I received a lot of positive feedback from classmates. Many of them starred ⭐ and forked 🍴 my repository, and some provided helpful comments and issue suggestions through GitHub and WhatsApp.

Specific feedback included:
- Suggestions to clarify the README onboarding steps
- Requests to improve route filtering and dashboard features
- Encouragement to maintain clean commit history and improve visibility of test results

---

## How I Applied the Feedback

- I updated the `README.md` to include clear “Getting Started” and “CI Status” sections.
- I labeled issues for first-time contributors and added a `ROADMAP.md` to show where the project is going.
- I simplified the GitHub Actions CI setup and added test run screenshots.

## Challenges

- It was tricky to explain everything clearly enough for others to contribute without asking me privately.
- GitHub's permissions and branch protection rules sometimes slowed down updates, especially with pull requests.
- Making the project understandable to someone new required writing much better documentation than I expected.

## What I Learned

This assignment taught me how real open source collaboration works — not just writing code, but:
- Structuring a project to be contributor-friendly
- Creating good first issues and labeling tasks
- Responding to peer feedback in a constructive way
- Maintaining a public repo with proper workflows and documentation

I now feel more confident managing real-world collaborative projects using GitHub.
