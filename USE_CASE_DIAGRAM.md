# ðŸ“Œ  Written Explanation
1. Key Actors and Their Roles
Student â†’ Tracks shuttle locations and views routes.
Shuttle Driver â†’ Updates the shuttleâ€™s real-time location.
Administrator â†’ Manages schedules and routes.
Campus Security â†’ Monitors shuttle logs for safety.
IT Support â†’ Ensures the system runs smoothly.
Shuttle Service Provider â†’ Oversees overall shuttle operations.
2. Relationships Between Actors and Use Cases
"Manage Schedules & Routes" <<includes>> "Update Shuttle Location" â†’ Because updating routes requires location updates.
"Monitor Shuttle Logs" <<extends>> "Generate Reports" â†’ Because security may sometimes need reports but not always.
3. How the Diagram Addresses Stakeholder Concerns
Students & Drivers â†’ Can track shuttles in real-time.
Admins â†’ Can manage routes and schedules easily.
Security â†’ Can monitor shuttles for safety.
IT Team â†’ Can maintain system reliability.
