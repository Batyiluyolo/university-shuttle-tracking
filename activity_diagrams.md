## 1. Activity Diagram – Student Checks Shuttle Location

### Scenario: A student opens the web app to view the shuttle's real-time position and route.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Open Shuttle Tracking Web App] --> B[Login if required]
    B --> C[Select Shuttle or Route]
    C --> D[Send request to Backend API]
    D --> E[API fetches real-time location from GPS]
    E --> F[Location data returned to frontend]
    F --> G[Display shuttle position on map]
    G --> H[Student views map and plans trip]
```

---

### Explanation

This activity represents the student’s flow from accessing the shuttle web app to successfully viewing a live shuttle location on the map.  
The process includes selecting a route, requesting GPS data from the backend, and displaying that data in real-time.

This interaction supports the student's need to plan efficiently by offering up-to-date shuttle visibility.
