## 🚍 1. State Transition Diagram – Shuttle

### 🎯 Object: Shuttle

This state diagram shows the lifecycle of a shuttle during its operation in the University Shuttle Tracking Web App.

    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> InTransit : Trip Assigned
    InTransit --> Idle : Trip Completed
    Idle --> Offline : GPS Signal Lost
    InTransit --> Offline : GPS Signal Lost
    Offline --> Idle : Signal Restored
```

### 📝 Explanation

The Idle state represents a shuttle that is available but not currently transporting passengers.  
When a trip is assigned, the shuttle transitions to the In Transit state.  
Upon completing the trip, the shuttle returns to Idle.  
If at any point the GPS signal is lost, the shuttle enters the Offline state.  
When the signal is restored, the shuttle returns to Idle.  

This state model enables the system to handle live tracking, trip status management, and GPS connectivity issues effectively.
