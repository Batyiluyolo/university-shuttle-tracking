# Template Analysis â€“ GitHub Project Templates for Agile Development

In this section, I evaluate three GitHub project templates suitable for Agile project management and select the one most aligned with the needs of the **CPUT Shuttle Tracking Web App** project.

## Comparison of GitHub Project Templates

| Template Name          | Columns Included                        | Strengths                                                                 | Weaknesses                                                              | Suitable For                    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban Board** | To Do, In Progress, Done                | Simple and easy to use. Ideal for small projects.                        | Lacks customization (e.g., no QA or Testing columns).                   | Small individual/team projects  |
| **Automated Kanban**   | To Do, In Progress, Review in Progress, Done | Auto-moves tasks based on issue status. Saves time on manual tracking.  | Might be too rigid for custom workflows.                                | Medium-sized Agile teams        |
| **Scrum Template**     | Backlog, Selected for Sprint, In Progress, Done | Follows Scrum workflow. Supports planning and reviews.                  | Assumes strict Scrum roles. Might be too formal for small teams.        | Scrum teams with defined roles  |

## Selected Template: **Basic Kanban Board (with Customization)**

### **Justification:**
I chose the **Basic Kanban Board** because:
- It is **simple, flexible, and customizable**, making it ideal for this academic project.
- I can **manually create extra columns** such as:
  - **"Testing"**
  - **"Blocked"**
- It helps visualize the workflow clearly without unnecessary complexity.

### Customizations Planned:
- Add new columns: **"Ready for Review", "Testing", "Blocked"**.
- Assign issues and use labels like `bug`, `feature`, etc.
- Manually move tasks between stages as work progresses.

## Conclusion:
While automated and Scrum templates are useful for large teams or formal Agile setups, the **customized Basic Kanban** provides the **best balance between simplicity and visibility** for tracking progress in this student-led sprint.
